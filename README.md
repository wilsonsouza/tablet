The Track Tablet APP (ViaApp) is an Android application developed to manage emergency situations in unattended toll lanes. These lanes, including automatic (AVI) and auxiliary/free lanes, operate without a staffed operator. The application's primary function is to resolve temporary malfunctions and anomalies within the automatic toll collection system.
